      <p>Features provide sections of your site that pertain to a specific kind of content, such as a blog, publication or announcement. You can enable or disable features individually within the Control Panel.&nbsp; Most features come with helper elements to assist with publishing and managing your content, including:</p>
<p><strong>Menu Entry</strong> -&nbsp; Most features will automatically create a link in your site's primary menu that will show all the content&nbsp; of the feature. So, if you enable the "Announcement" feature, an "Announcement" link appear in your primary menu that will display all of your announcements.</p>

This "web content" could be a variety of things, from a list of featured posts, to a gallery of recent images, to a site search tool.

The Control Panel provides and easy way to arrange your widgets by dragging and dropping them to marked sections of your site's layout.</p>
