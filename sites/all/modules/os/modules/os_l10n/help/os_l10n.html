<h1>Translation</h1>
<p>
Drupal localization modules allow site users to translate site content on the fly.  
These translations are published back to Drupal so other sites can make use of them.  
Each Drupal installation can be configured to periodically check for new translation
updates.
</p>

<p>
OpenScholar includes several modules for facilitating the translation process.
</p>

<h1>For Site Administrators</h1>
<p>
To enable localization on your OpenScholar installation, follow these steps:
	<ol>
	  <li>Enable l10n_client, l10n_update, and os_l10n modules.</li>
	  <li>Give your users permissions to translate.  You may wish to create a translator
	   role to assign to users.
	    <ul>
	      <li><b>use on-page translation</b> This permission will let users translate 
	        text on your site.</li>
	      <li><b>submit translations to localization server</b> This permission will 
	        let translators send their translations back to our server</li>
	    </ul>
	  <li>Change the default language.  English is fully translated already.  In order to
	    access the translation GUI, your site needs to use a langauge that isn't fully
	    translated.</li>
	</ol>
</p>

<h1>For Translators</h1>
<p>
  At the bottom of each page you should be able to see the translate bar.  If you cannot, 
  your site/account has not been configured properly for translation.  Send your site admin
  an email requesting translating permission.  
  <img src="path:translate_bar.png" />
<p>

<p>
  To begin translating, click on the translate bar.  This will open up a pane at the 
  bottom of your screen.  On the left of that pane is a list of bits of text that appear
  on this page.  Text with a green background has already been translated into your
  language.  Everything else is still waiting to be translated.
</p>

<p>
  Click on a piece of text from the left hand column.  The original text will be displayed
  in the center of the screen.  On the right, you'll be able to provide a translation.
  Enter your translation and then click the save button.
</p>
  
<p>
  If you would like the translations you create to be available to other OpenScholar sites,
  you'll have to set up an account on OpenScholar's translation server. 
  <ol>
    <li>Log in to your OpenScholar site and go to your account (<i>domain.com</i>/user).</li>
    <li>Click edit.</li> 
    <li>Find the Localization Client section.</li>
    <li>Click the link provided in below the API key.
      <ul>
        <li>This link will take you to the OpenScholar translation server.  You will need 
        an account here to proceed.  If you have not already done so, create that account.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>When the account has been created and you've already logged in, click the API
      key link again.  That will take you to a page on the translation server that
      displays your API key.  It will be a series of 35 numbers and letters.</li>
    <li>Copy your API key and paste it into the API key section of your account on
    the first site.</li>
  </ol>
  
  And that's all.  You won't need to visit the OpenScholar translation server again after
  you've obtained your API key.
