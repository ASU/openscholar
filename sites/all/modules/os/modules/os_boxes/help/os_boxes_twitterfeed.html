<p>This widget allows you to embed a twitter feed into your page, pulling in tweets from the account you enter in the username field. You may use common twitter syntax to pull in your tweets, everything you've posted, or any given tag.</p>
<p>This widget is very tall, so it is best used in a side bar.</p>
