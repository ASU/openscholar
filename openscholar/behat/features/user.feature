Feature: User page access
  In order to access exclusive personalized content
  As a site visitor
  I need to be be shown my user profile only when logging in.

  @api
  Scenario: User pages are inaccessible to anonymous users.
    Given I am not logged in
     Then I should be redirected in the following <cases>:
  #  | Request                    | Response Code | Final URL   |
     | users/admin                | 403           | users/admin |

  @api
  Scenario: User pages are accessible to the logging in user.
    Given I am logging in as "john"
     When I visit "/user"
     Then I should see "View"
      And I should see "Edit"
