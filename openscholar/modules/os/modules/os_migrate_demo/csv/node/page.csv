page3,About CERN,"What is the universe made of? How did it start? Physicists at CERN are seeking answers, using some of the world's most powerful particle accelerators. <br><br> At CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, physicists and engineers are probing the fundamental structure of the universe. They use the world's largest and most complex scientific instruments to study the basic constituents of matter – the fundamental particles. The particles are made to collide together at close to the speed of light. The process gives the physicists clues about how the particles interact, and provides insights into the fundamental laws of nature. The instruments used at CERN are purpose-built particle accelerators and detectors. Accelerators boost beams of particles to high energies before the beams are made to collide with each other or with stationary targets. Detectors observe and record the results of these collisions. Founded in 1954, the CERN laboratory sits astride the Franco-Swiss border near Geneva. It was one of Europe's first joint ventures and now has 21 member states.",project2,,,user2
page4,Experiments,"A range of experiments at CERN investigate physics from cosmic rays to supersymmetry. <br><br> <h3>LHC experiments</h3>Seven experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) use detectors to analyse the myriad of particles produced by collisions in the accelerator. These experiments are run by collaborations of scientists from institutes all over the world. Each experiment is distinct, and characterized by its detectors.<br><br>The biggest of these experiments, ATLAS and CMS, use general-purpose detectors to investigate the largest range of physics possible. Having two independently designed detectors is vital for cross-confirmation of any new discoveries made. ALICE and LHCb have detectors specialized for focusing on specific phenomena. These four detectors sit underground in huge caverns on the LHC ring.<br><br>The smallest experiments on the LHC are TOTEM and LHCf, which focus on ""forward particles"" – protons or heavy ions that brush past each other rather than meeting head on when the beams collide. TOTEM uses detectors positioned on either side of the CMS interaction point, while LHCf is made up of two detectors which sit along the LHC beamline, at 140 metres either side of the ATLAS collision point. MoEDAL uses detectors deployed near LHCb to search for a hypothetical particle called the magnetic monopole. <br><br><h3>Non-LHC experiments</h3>While the main focus of research at CERN has moved in recent years towards the LHC, experiments at other accelerators and facilities both on-site and off remain an important part of the laboratory’s activities.<br><br>In “fixed-target” experiments, a beam of accelerated particles is directed at a solid, liquid or gas target, which itself can be part of the detection system. COMPASS, which looks at the structure of hadrons – particles made of quarks – uses beams from the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS). NA61/SHINE studies the properties of hadrons in collisions of beam particles with fixed targets. NA62 uses protons from the SPS to study rare decays of kaons. DIRAC is investigating the strong force between quarks at the Proton Synchrotron (PS). The CLOUD experiment is investigating a possible link between cosmic rays and cloud formation. ACE, AEGIS, ALPHA, ASACUSA, and ATRAP all use antiprotons from the Antiproton Decelerator, while the CAST experiment is looking for hypothetical particles coming not from collisions at the accelerators but from the Sun.<br><br>Experimental facilities at CERN include the Radioactive Ion Beam facility (ISOLDE) and the neutron time-of-flight facility (nTOF).<br>This diverse research programme ensures that CERN covers a wide range of topics in physics, from kaons to cosmic rays, and from the Standard Model to supersymmety.",project2,cern_aegis.jpg;cern_alpha.jpg;cern_asacusa.jpg;cern_cast.jpg;cern_miniball.jpg,About CERN,-20,user2
page5,Physics,"The research programme at CERN covers topics from kaons to cosmic rays, and from the Standard Model to supersymmetry. CERN's main focus is particle physics – the study of the fundamental constituents of matter – but the physics programme at the laboratory is much broader, ranging from nuclear to high-energy physics, from studies of antimatter to the possible effects of cosmic rays on clouds. Since the 1970s, particle physicists have described the fundamental structure of matter using an elegant series of equations called the Standard Model. The model describes how everything that they observe in the universe is made from a few basic blocks called fundamental particles, governed by four forces. Physicists at CERN use the world's most powerful particle accelerators and detectors to test the predictions and limits of the Standard Model. Over the years it has explained many experimental results and precisely predicted a range of phenomena, such that today it is considered a well-tested physics theory. But the model only describes the 4% of the known universe, and questions remain. Will we see a unification of forces at the high energies of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)? Why is gravity so weak? Why is there more matter than antimatter in the universe? Is there more exotic physics waiting to be discovered at higher energies? Will we discover evidence for a theory called supersymmetry at the LHC? Or understand the Higgs boson that gives particles mass?",project2,,About CERN,-19,user2
page6,Computing,"Experiments at CERN generate colossal amounts of data. The Data Centre stores it, and sends it around the world for analysis. <br><br> Approximately 600 million times per second, particles collide within the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Each collision generates particles that often decay in complex ways into even more particles. Electronic circuits record the passage of each particle through a detector as a series of electronic signals, and send the data to the CERN Data Centre (DC) for digital reconstruction. The digitized summary is recorded as a "collision event". Physicists must sift through the 15 petabytes or so of data produced annually to determine if the collisions have thrown up any interesting physics.",project2,,About CERN,-17,user2
page7,Engineering,"There are 10 times more engineers and technicians at CERN than research physicists. Why? <br><br> The physics programme at CERN presents engineers with varied challenges at the forefront of technology, from the atomic scale to the colossal. Engineers build and test the machines and systems that physicists rely on, and technicians to keep these systems running smoothly, performing repairs and upgrades where necessary. Building a particle accelerator, for example, can require civil engineering: digging tunnels and installing large infrastructure projects. Other engineers and technicians assemble components: radiofrequency cavities must be crafted to just the right shape and size to boost particles along accelerators; thousands of huge, custom-built electromagnets focus particle beams and guide them around bends in circular accelerators; and the world's largest cryogenic system cools magnets on the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) to close to absolute zero, so that the wires supplying their electricity can work in a superconducting state, without losing energy to resistance. Detectors present other engineering challenges. Their components and subsystems are designed, built and tested separately, before they are joined together to work in harmony. Kilometres of wiring and thousands of electrical components make particle detectors a complex feat of engineering. Engineers are vital to CERN's activities – to push the boundaries of experimental physics, they're building some of the most advanced machines in the world.",project2,,About CERN,-16,user2
